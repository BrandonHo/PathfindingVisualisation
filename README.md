# React Pathfinding Visualiser

This react project provides a visualisation of pathfinding algorithms. I primarily created this project to learn about and become more familiar with React hooks. This project specifically uses functional components (with React hooks), rather than class components.

This project is inspired by Clement Mihailescu's video about a pathfinding visualiser project, which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/n4t_-NjY_Sg).
