# React Pathfinding Visualisation

This react project provides a visualisation of pathfinding algorithms. I primarily created this project to learn about and become more familiar with React hooks. A live demonstration of the pathfinding visualiser can be found at the following [link](https://brandonho.github.io/PathfindingVisualisation/).

This project is inspired by Clement Mihailescu's video about a pathfinding visualiser project, which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/n4t_-NjY_Sg).
